Digital systems obtain binary-coded data and information that are constantly being worked on in some way. 
Some of the operations include:

1. Multiplexing
2. Demultiplexing
3. Decoding and Encoding

These operations and others have been encouraged by the accessibility of various ICs in the MSI 
(medium-scale-incorporation) classification. 
In this module, we will study about many of the common types of MSI devices. 
For each type, we will begin with a brief discussion of its essential working rule and then introduce specific ICs. 
We at that point show how they can be utilized alone or in combination with different ICs in different applications.
