# Full Subtractors
{: .no_toc }

The full subtractor is a combinational circuit with three inputs A,B,C and two outputs D and C'. It is developed to overcome the drawbacks of half subtractor.  
A is the 'minuend', B is 'subtrahend', C is the 'borrow' produced by the previous stage, D is the difference output and C' is the borrow output.
