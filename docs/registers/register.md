# Digital Registers
{: .no_toc }

Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the digital data. 
To increase the storage capacity, we have to use a group of flip-flop. This group of flip-flop is known as a Register. 
The n-bit register consist of "n" number of flip-flop and  is capable of storing an "n-bit" word.

The binary data in a register can be moved within the flip flops in a register. 
The registers that allows such data transfers are called as shift registers. 
There are four mode of operations of a shift register.
