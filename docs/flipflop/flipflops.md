# Flip-Flops
{: .no_toc }

In previous module, we discussed about Latches. Latches are the basic building blocks of flip-flops. Flip-flops are the most elemented device which can store data. We can implement flip-flops in two methods.

1. Cascading two latches in such a way that the first latch is enabled for every positive clock pulse and second latch is enabled for every negative clock pulse, so that the combination of these two latches will become a flip-flop.

2. We can directly implement the flip-flop, which is edge sensitive. 
In this module, let us discuss the following flip-flops using second method.



## Conclusion

In this module, we have implemented various flip-flops by providing the cross coupling between NOR gates. 
As an excercise to the reader, try implementing these flip-flops by using NAND gates.
