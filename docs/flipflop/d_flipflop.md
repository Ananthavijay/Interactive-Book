## D Flip-Flop

D flip-flop or Data flip-flop operates with just positive clock changes or negative clock changes. Though, D latch operates with enable signal. That implies the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input D and two outputs Q(t) & Q(t)â€™. The operation of D flip-flop is like D Latch. But, this flip-flop influences the outputs only when positive change of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable.


### State table of **D** flip-flop.

| Clk | D    |    Q(t+1) | 
|:---:|:-------|:--------|
| 0 | X |  Q(t) | 
| 1 | 0 |  1    |
| 1 | 1 |  1    |

Therefore, D flip-flop consistently holds the data, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as
```yaml
        Q(t + 1) = D
```
Next state of the D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be utilized in registers, shift registers and some of the digital counters.
